# Wonderful Queue

## Questions

10.1. Using an array gives you the ability to index/ access data in a specific location within the array more efficiently.

10.2. Since a linked list is dynamic and does not have a fixed size, you can allocate more memory dynamically as needed, and this
      can be more efficient. In contrast, an array is static, with a fixed size and memory allocation before compiling and you
      may end up wasting space by allocating more memory than needed, or run into problems if you understimate the memory needed.

10.3. A queue would be more dynamic in Python, you can add different data types and append or delete items more easily than in C.

10.4. A queue would be faster in C because it takes less memory.

10.5. to add a shirt    q.append('s')
      to remove shirt       q.remove('s')  **The question asked about removing "another shirt" - meaning not shirt s? I'm not sure
      how to do that in one line of code without knowing what that other shirt is called, otherwise, I'd create a loop to iterate
      through the list and remove the 1st value that is != "s" then end the program.
