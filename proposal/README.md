# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Buyel' ekhaya," it means 'return home' and this name will probably change :)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that collects Zimbabwean users' information (regardless of current location) and displays high level summaries of all
responses.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

As a Zimbabwean who has lived outside the country for nearly 10 years, I intend to use this site to figure out why most people
in my position left home, and figure out what life in Zimbabwe is like for people considering moving back. I'm trying to get
meaningful data to characterize the working class and rising working class in Zimbabwe, and better understand brain drain and
the potential for wealth accrual within Zimbabwe. The website will have the following pages and functions:
    1. Home page - brief summary of project goals and links to all the other pages. Mention that I may use this data for an op-ed.
    2. Survey page
        - disclaimer and privacy notice
        - actual survey with questions on age, income, employment, and a few living expenses. I will not collect names.
        - error checking of inputs, I'll explore ways, and teh pros/cons of error checking after an individuals response is filled in
        - upon submit, a respondent will be rerouted to a page with the summary results. Is this a way to make sure only individuals
          who have completed the survey can view the summary results?
    3. Summary Results page
        - high level summary with one or more interactive graphs, but more than one static graph summarizing the results that
          have been submitted
        - results summary grouped by individuals based in Zimbabwe/ currently not based in Zimbabwe/ by continent
        - summary will include both texts and graphs and will summarize each question
        - I'll explore ways to make this interesting
    4. About me page
        - summary of why I'm making this project.
        - if you filled out the survey way back and need to see the results - email me
        - a contact me text box that directs the emails to my gmail account


## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No longer relevant.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I'll have an ugly functional survey page, database, and at least two ugly summary graphics, no matter what.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I'll have a pretty and functional survey page, database, and at least three pretty summary graphics by based in Zimbabwe/currently
not based in Zimbabwe.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything described in the third question.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
1. Explore privacy concerns or data security concerns - survey will be anonymous and self-reported but I want to be sure no one can
   download the data or manipulate data already in my database.
2. Figure out platforms to make this public - ask CS50 heads and TA
3. Explore the best options for moving data from a database into graphics
3. Learn how to make graphics in the language that is most appropriate for displaying this info on a website
4. Explore ways of making meaningful interactive graphs
5. Develop survey questions and get feedback on them
6. Tell all my Zimbabwean friends about this and tell them I'll be spamming them with links soon.
