## Questions

5.1. unique username, comment (actual comment text), and unique comment_ID (an ID that identifies the original post that the
     user commented on)

5.2. I imagine there is another table that also gets updated when a user posts a reply, maybe this table has the username,
     the comment_ID mentioned in my response to 5.1, as well as a unique commentorder (another ID that has the order of the comment,
     for example, maybe a Facebook post is 1st order, a comment on that post is 2nd order, a reply to the comment is 3rd order, etc).
     Facebook then uses the two IDs and username to link replies to specific comments and posts.

5.3. See `memes.html`.
