                        Hello! <br>
                        I'm Noma and I'm a first-year graduate student at the Forestry School. My parents started teaching me how
                        to cook when I was six, and by the time I was 10, I was very comfortable experimenting in the kitchen. I really
                        enjoy cooking and eating, and I thought I'd enjoy this PSet if I just talked about food!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       Besides eating and cooking, I also enjoy dancing, hiking, and reading auto-biographies. I'm also learning how to
                       code and I've written some chunks in C like <code>printf("Hello world!\n")</code>.
                    </p>
