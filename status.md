Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've made a functional survey page (without error checking), bare bones Aboout me and home pages, and a database.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Figured out how to analyze survey responses, set up a page to display analyzed results, and worked on any aesthetics.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Figuring out how to analyze the results and create graphics. I'll watch some videos tonight and I'm meeting with my project advisor tomorrow.
