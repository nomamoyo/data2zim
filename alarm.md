# False Alarm

## Questions

2.1. The second UI still uses acronyms and the only difference between the drill and 'real' alert options are just the words DRILL
     and the acronym in parentheses which are insufficient and easy to overlook. Further, the numbering looks weird and this
     screen omits other options that were previously availble. The list is also sorted alphabetically which is not so intuitive
     because the options are not well-named and someone who's in a rush to send an alert would need to read through the entire list
     to find the alert they need.

2.2. I think both the human and UI are to blame. The design of that UI is awful, it doesn't make it easy for the user to locate the
     appropriate button and send the alert. There seems to be no checks or confirmation requirements to make sure the user selected
     what they want. I think the human is also to blame because they could have been more meticulous in making sure they were
     clicking on the right button, but I blame them less than the UI.

2.3a. HTML - I'd create a dropdown list with "drill", "real situation", and "other message" whereby the user selects an option,
      clicks submit, and gets rerouted to another page where they can select the relevant alert. I'd also add a back button on the
      alert pages to make sure the user can return to the previous page if they accidentally picked the wrong item off the dropdown
      list. I'd also get rid of all the acronyms and spell everything out. I'd rename the alerts to make them more descriptive.
      I'd add a final submit alert page where the user has the option to review the message being sent out, confirm, and submit it,
      i.e., apply the same logic as online shopping checkout just before you click "place order."

2.3b. CSS - I'd use different colors for "drill", "real situation", "other message" and the corresponding messages. I'd make real
      situation alerts red, drills black, and other messages blue.

2.3c. Javascript - I'd create error checking in the form of pop-ups asking the user if they are sure they wanted to select that
      alert and asking for confirmation before sending the alert. I'd also add an info icon next to each alert with a short but more
      detailed description of the alert.

2.4. I might use SQL to keep track of the users logged in and the actions they completed (i.e. alerts they sent) while logged in.

2.5. The human could still click on the wrong buttons and confirm wrong data because everyone just clicks accept, accept, accept,
     when prompted via dialogue boxes and confirmation pages. Also, the human could turn off javascript on their browser and my
     pop-ups wouldn't work.
