# Complementary Questions

## Questions

7.1. It means the cipher text is very difficult and close to impossible to decipher without knowing the encryption key and
     encryption method.

7.2. It wouldn't take long for someone to decipher the text because all the letters are being shifted by a constant number using a
     simple mathematical operation.

7.3. Slanted also shifts letters around using a constant key, but a more complicated encryption method. If someone can figure out a
     single word or phrase from the cipher text, they can explore whether common encryption methods could have been used and
     quickly figure out the method and deciper the message.

7.4. The message would stay exactly the same.

7.5. Hashing iterates through the password and adds an irregular (not constant) number of characters to mask the password, in the
     end, you don't really know how long the actual password is and which characters were originally in the password. On the other
     hand, I have not learnt of encryption adding additional characters to the plain text, it just jumbles up the plain text based on
     a key and encryption method.

7.6. See `slanted.py`.
