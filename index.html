                Hi Friends!<br>
                This homepage, along with the three "child" pages you can access via the buttons above are about
                how much I love food, especially food from my home country, Zimbabwe. In the child pages I tell you a little
                about myself, share a few recipes from Zimbabwe, and share links to some of my most memorable food experiences
                outside Zimbabwe. My native language is Ndebele, and the name of my website "Dlana Lathi" means come dine with
                us. I gave my website that name because me and my roomates enjoy sharing meals with people over fun conversation,
                useless arguments, and quality bonding time. So join us for dinner sometime, we make some darn good food!
                </p>
