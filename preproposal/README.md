# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. I've been working with Professor Angel Hsu on a report that she intends to turn into a WordPress site. All the text has already
    been transferred to WordPress and I was thinking of making about 30 of the static graphs in the report interactive using d3,
    javascript, and R. I'd be happy to share the report via email.
2. I really enjoy working with data, so I'd appreaciate some pointers. I'm not sure if there are any privacy law concerns, but I
    could create a census-like survey with questions about income, energy access, employment etc. hosted on a website and display
    the summary results dynamically (some on a map) for some non-sensitive variables. This survey would be intended for people in Zimbabwe, because
    that's where I'm from and our data collection infrastructure is horrible.
3. A game with some environmental education for kids?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I don't have plans to work with someone else, but if you know someone looking for a teammate I'd consider it.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

None right now.
